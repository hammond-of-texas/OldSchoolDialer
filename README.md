# OldSchoolDialer

## What it does

When you start the application, it disconnects the internet and shows a dial-up dialog.

When you click "connect", it shows a connection dialog and makes dial-up noises. After that, it re-connects to the internet.

###### Idea what to use for

As a joke, you could i.e. the application, which disconnects you from the internet. Then open chrome and show a friend that your internet is not working.

Say, "Oh, I forgot to dial in." and switch back to the app. Then click connect and after it has "connected" show that you're not connected to the famous world wide web.
